# Convex hulls assignment

This assignment uses 3 algorithms to calculate the convex hulls of various datasets, the algorithms used are:
1. Gift-wrap
2. Grahamscan
3. Monotone chain

All of the algorithms are called from the testing suite to generate graphs and validate inputs using matplotlib and a txt containing the correct outputs

Run by excecuting `python3 convexhull_time.py`

**Warning:** Generating graphs may take time when choosing the graphical method 

**Warning:** Datasets must be in './Sets/' otherwise the testing function will break, included is a zipfile containing the testing methods and the correct data-structure
